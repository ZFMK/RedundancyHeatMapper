### Purpose 
RedundancyHeatMapper produces a heat map from a distance matrix with values of 
lambda obtained using SatuRation (https://github.com/lsjermiin/SatuRation.v1.0).
            
Lambda is a measure of the loss of historical signal across sites in a pair of
sequences. If lambda = 0, there is no evidence of loss of historical signal; if 
lambda = 1, the historical signal has decayed completely.
            
The higher lambda is, the darker the corresponding pixel in the heat map.

Emphasis is on lambda values between 0.0 and 0.3, allowing the sequence pairs
that are most similar to one another to be identified.
            
### Format
Lambda values must be saved in a text file with comma-separated values (.csv).

The first line must contain the number of samples being compared. 

Each of the following lines must start with a sample name, and then followed
by the lambda values, one for each comparison involving the named sample.
 
### Example
See file labelled 0_Recombination_lambda.csv.

### Install
To install RedundancyHeatMapper.pl, type (in the command line):

            sudo cp RedundancyHeatMapper.pl /usr/local/bin/. 

### Execute
    RedundancyHeatMapper -i <infile.csv> <-t|f>

### Help
    -t = triangular heat map; -f = square heat map

### Status
Software complete
