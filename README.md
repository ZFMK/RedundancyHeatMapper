### Purpose     
RedundancyHeatMapper produces a heat map from a distance matrix with values of lambda obtained by SatuRation (https://github.com/lsjermiin/SatuRation.v1.0).
            
Lambda is a measure of the strength of the historical signal between a pair of sequences. If lambda = 0, there is no evidence of loss of historical signal; 
if lambda = 1, the historical signal has decayed completely.
            
The higher lambda is, the darker the corresponding pixel in the heat map is.

Emphasis is on lambda values between 0.0 and 0.37, allowing pairs of sequences that are most similar to one another to be identified.
            
### Format      
Lambda values must be saved in a text file with comma-separated values (.csv).

The first line must contain the number of samples being compared. 

Each of the following lines must start with a sample name, and then followed by the lambda values, one for each comparison involving the named sample.
 
### Example     
See file labelled 0_Recombination_lambda.csv.

### Install     
To install RedundancyHeatMapper.pl, type (in the command line):

    sudo cp RedundancyHeatMapper.pl /usr/local/bin/. 

### Execute     
    RedundancyHeatMapper -i <infile.csv> <-t|f>

### Help        
    -t = triangular heat map; -f = square heat map

### Status      
Software complete
